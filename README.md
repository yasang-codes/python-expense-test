This is a sample Python project.
The project is a simple expense tracker. No GUI.
You can add, delete and view expenses.

Nice to haves:

1. Data Analysis
2. Categorization of spending (Done! But should think about if I want fixed categories and the ability to create categories?)
3. Viewing in chunks - by category, by year/month/quarter etc.
4. Eventual GUI
